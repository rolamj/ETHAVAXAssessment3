# ETH+AVAX Assessment 3

## Overview

This is a project with a smart contract that create, destroys, and transfers token. The smart contract allows to name your own token and also set a smbol for it. The functions are the following:

1. The contract owner should be able to mint tokens to a provided address.

2. Any user should be able to burn and transfer tokens.

## Getting Started

To run and interact with this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Here are the steps to get started:

### Execution Instructions

1. Go to the Remix website at [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

2. Create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar.

3. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., ERC20Token.sol).

4. Copy and paste the provided Solidity code in the link https://github.com/rolamj/ETHAVAXAssessment3/blob/main/ERC20Token.sol and paste into the newly created file.

5. Compile the code by clicking on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Ensure that the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile ERC20Token.sol" button.

6. Deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.

7. Interact with the contract.
